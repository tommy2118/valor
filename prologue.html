      <h2>The World Behind the Curtain</h2>
      <p>The world as we know it thrives on order—a fragile construct maintained by systems of power, governance, and technology. But lurking beneath the surface lies a constant threat to this delicate balance. Covert forces, rogue elements, and the unstoppable march of technology threaten to unravel the very fabric of modern society.</p>
      <p>To protect what cannot be seen, there exist those who cannot be known. Ghosts in the machine. Shadows in the light. <span class="highlight">Project Apex</span> is their bastion, and its operatives are humanity's last line of defense against a world spiraling into chaos.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Birth of a Specter</h2>
      <p><span class="highlight">Marcus Steele</span> was a man of structure, discipline, and precision—a rising star within the Air Force. But his life changed forever the day he was recruited into a program that officially does not exist. Stripped of his old identity, Marcus was reborn as <span class="highlight">Specter 6</span>, a covert operative in a war fought in the shadows.</p>
      <p>Now, he walks a razor’s edge between two realities: the open world of his cover identity as a recruiter and the hidden, high-stakes missions that define his true existence. To those who see only his surface, Marcus is an ordinary man. To those who know better, he is a force of calculated precision, living proof that the greatest battles are fought in silence.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What Lies Ahead</h2>
      <p>The Shadow of Valor explores the cost of duality—the toll of living a double life where every truth is layered with deception. For Marcus, the question is not just about surviving but about maintaining the fragile balance between who he was and what he has become.</p>
      <p>As Specter 6, he will face enemies that challenge the limits of human ingenuity and allies whose loyalty wavers in the face of unseen threats. But the greatest battle Marcus will fight is within himself, as the lines between light and shadow blur and the cost of valor becomes all too clear.</p>

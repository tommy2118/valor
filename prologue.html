    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p>The first thing Colonel Adrienne Harper noticed about Airman Basic <span class="highlight">Marcus Steele</span> wasn’t his perfect posture or his exemplary service record—it was the way his eyes constantly scanned, assessed, adapted. Even in the sterile confines of her office, he was mapping exits, analyzing angles, preparing for contingencies he couldn’t yet name.</p>
      <p>“Do you know why you’re here, Airman?” Harper’s voice carried the weight of authority, but there was something else there—anticipation.</p>
      <p>“No, ma’am.” Marcus’s response was crisp, professional. But his mind was racing. The summons to this unmarked facility had come through unusual channels. No paper trail. No digital footprint.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>A New World</h2>
      <p>“Welcome to <span class="highlight">Project Apex</span>, Airman. We exist in superposition—here and not here. Present and absent. Living and theoretical.”</p>
      <p>With those words, Marcus Steele’s life as Specter 6 began. Operating in the shadows, beyond the reach of traditional military structure, Project Apex’s operatives are ghosts in a shadow war for global stability. Victories uncelebrated. Sacrifices unacknowledged.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Duality</h2>
      <p>To civilians, Marcus Steele was a clean-cut Air Force recruiter. To those who knew better, he was Specter 6—a covert operative in a hidden war. His tribal tattoo, a mark of tradition to most, was a quantum-encrypted key to secure operations.</p>
      <p>Every mission tested his dual identity. Each scar told a story his cover couldn’t explain. Every victory carried a cost. Yet, in those shadows, Marcus found his purpose.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Living in the Shadows</h2>
      <p>As he stared at his reflection—one part Airman, one part ghost—Marcus knew the truth. His greatest battles would never be recorded. His brightest triumphs would forever remain in the dark. And yet, he pressed on, a solitary figure guarding a world that would never know it needed protecting.</p>

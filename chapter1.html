    <p class="mb-8">The first thing Colonel Adrienne Harper noticed about Airman Basic Marcus Steele wasn't his perfect posture or his exemplary service record—it was the way his eyes constantly scanned, assessed, adapted. Even in the sterile confines of her office, he was mapping exits, analyzing angles, preparing for contingencies he couldn't yet name.</p>

        <p>Marcus stepped out of the helicopter, his service uniform pristine despite the long journey to this unmarked facility.</p>

        <p>Colonel Harper stood silhouetted in the doorway, her presence radiating authority and something else—anticipation.</p>

        <p>Harper's office was a study in contradictions—sleek technology blending with heavy reinforcement, her reflection fragmenting across the armored glass.</p>

        <p class="dialogue text-center"><strong>Harper:</strong> "...a space where the normal rules of engagement evolve."</p>
        <p>Her eyes locked onto Marcus, sharp and assessing, hinting at augmentations that went beyond the strictly human.</p>

        <p class="italic text-center">Unusual channels. Unmarked facility. Quantum encryption on the summons.<br>The pieces were assembling into an unsettling picture.</p>
        <p>Marcus stood ramrod straight, his exterior calm belying the cyclone of thoughts beneath.</p>

        <p class="sfx absolute bottom-0 right-0 m-4">hummmmm</p>
        <p>The room filled with the electric hum of holographic projections springing to life, casting Harper and Marcus in an ethereal blue glow—schematics and secrets hanging in the air between them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>In that moment, Marcus understood that the world as he knew it was about to tilt on its axis. The only question was how far he'd let it pull him off course.</p>

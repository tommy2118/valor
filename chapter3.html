    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-center" id="chapter-3">Chapter 3: First Mission</h1>
    <p class="mb-8">Marcus Steele's first mission as Specter 6 would define his role within Project Apex. Tasked with infiltrating a high-profile corporate retreat, Marcus needed to uncover a mole selling quantum computing secrets to foreign agents. Failure was not an option.</p>

    <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-12">
      <div class="manga-panel">
        <img src="images/mission1.webp" alt="Marcus in a corporate setting">
        <p class="text-center italic">The disguise was flawless, but the stakes were higher than ever.</p>
        <p>Marcus blended seamlessly into the crowd, his tailored suit hiding a myriad of tactical tools. His every movement was calculated, his demeanor exuding calm professionalism.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="manga-panel">
        <img src="images/mission2.webp" alt="Marcus tailing a target">
        <div class="dialogue bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded">
          <p><strong>Harper (via comms):</strong> "Your target is on the move. Keep it quiet, Specter 6."</p>
          <p><strong>Marcus:</strong> "Understood."</p>
        </div>
        <p>Marcus’s precision and focus were unmatched as he tailed the suspect through the luxury resort. The faint hum of live music and laughter provided the perfect cover for his silent pursuit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="manga-panel">
        <p class="text-center italic">The tension was palpable.</p>
        <img src="images/mission3.webp" alt="Marcus in a confrontation">
        <p>Face-to-face with his target, Marcus had to balance diplomacy with the threat of force. His piercing gaze conveyed a silent warning, his hand subtly brushing the concealed weapon at his side.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="manga-panel">
        <img src="images/mission4.webp" alt="Marcus using tech gear">
        <p class="sfx text-center italic">beep beep beep</p>
        <p>Using a hidden interface embedded in his cufflink, Marcus extracted critical data from the target’s encrypted device. His fingers moved with practiced efficiency, bypassing security protocols with ease.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-span-2 manga-panel relative">
        <img src="images/mission5.webp" alt="Escape sequence">

          <p><strong>Harper:</strong> "Extraction point is compromised. Improvise!"</p>
          <p><strong>Marcus:</strong> "Copy that. I’ll find another way."</p>
        </div>
        <p>The tranquil resort became a maze of danger as Marcus’s calculated escape turned into a high-stakes chase. Security personnel, alerted by the breached device, were closing in fast.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="manga-panel">
        <img src="images/mission6.webp" alt="Marcus scaling a wall">
        <p class="sfx text-center italic">clink clink</p>
        <p>Scaling the resort’s outer wall, Marcus relied on his enhanced gloves to maintain a secure grip. The distant city lights reflected in his sharp, determined eyes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="manga-panel">
        <img src="images/mission7.webp" alt="Marcus reaching an extraction vehicle">
        <p class="dialogue bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded"><strong>Harper:</strong> "Vehicle en route. ETA two minutes."</p>
        <p>With adrenaline pumping and his cover intact, Marcus sprinted through an alley, evading the last of his pursuers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The mission’s success came at a cost—a scar below Marcus's hairline, earned in a split-second confrontation that nearly derailed the operation. But he had proven himself as Specter 6, securing vital intelligence that would tilt the balance in Project Apex’s favor.</p>
    <p>As Marcus watched the target's encrypted files decrypt in the safety of their command center, he couldn’t shake Harper’s earlier words: "Your greatest asset is your ability to adapt. Never forget that."</p>
